Simple features and Arithmatic of python:
1) Te print feature: This is the single most important function of python and pretty much any piece of code would be useless without it:
   It looks like this,  print("Hello world")
   The most important parts of this are: The P of print MUST be lower case and the text that you want to print MUST be in double quotation marks , "" .
   The command: print("Hello world") would print to the user's command line application the words- Hello world -
  
2)Commnts: A comment makes your code easier to understand and helps un-experianced coders to read the code, many of the programs we will share with you will include many comments.
  A comment is ignored by the computer so that it dosn't affect the code.
  A comment is distinguished by a hashtag at the start of the comment for expample:
 
 print("hello world") #This line prints the words: hello world
 
 In visual sudio a comment appears in green font.
 
 Arithmatic
 
 For this section we will be using python and the print command to do arithmatic:
 to print arithmatic you put the print command as usual but WITHOUT the quotation marks, for example:
  print(5 + 1)
  
 1) Addition:
   Addition in python is done with the " + " symbol.
   For example:
   5+1 would be shown as- 
   print(5 + 1)
   this would give an output of '6'
   
 2) Subtraction:
 Subtraction in python is done with the " - " symbol
 For example:
 5-1 would be shown as-
 print(5 - 1) 
 This would give the output of '4'
 
 3) Multiplication:
 Multiplication in python is done with the " * " symbol
 For example:
 5x1 would be shown as-
 print(5 * 1) 
 This would give the output of '5'
 
 4)Divison
 Division in python is done with the " / " symbol
 For example:
 5 divided by 1 would be shown as-
 print(5 % 1) 
 This would give the output of '5'
