Simple features of python:
1) the print feature: This is the single most important function of python and pretty much any piece of code would be useless without it:
   It looks like this,  print("Hello world")
   The most important parts of this are: The P of print MUST be lower case and the text that you want to print MUST be in double quotation marks , "" .
   The command: print("Hello world") would print to the user's command line application the words- Hello world -
